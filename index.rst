Getting Started
---------------

Welcome to the handson Workshop for Runbooks in CALM. This Workshop will cover the creation of an Endpoint for Linux and Windows VMs and a Runbook to execute specific tasks on those Endpoints. You will have to connect to a HPOC environment, the details for the HPOC are futher down. If any questions come up as part of the Workshop don't hesitate to ask.


Agenda
++++++

1. Create Endpoints: 

   - Linux
   - Windows

2. Create RunBooks:

   - RunBook for Windows patching
   - RunBook to scan RPMs on Linux

3. Hackathon Task


Initial Setup
+++++++++++++

- Take note of the *Passwords* being used.
- Log into your virtual desktops (connection info below)


Environment Details
+++++++++++++++++++

Nutanix Workshops are intended to be run in the Nutanix Hosted POC environment. Your cluster will be provisioned with all necessary images, networks, and VMs required to complete the exercises.

Networking
..........

Hosted POC clusters follow a standard naming convention:

- **Cluster Name** - POC\ *XYZ*
- **Subnet** - 10.**21**.\ *XYZ*\ .0
- **Cluster IP** - 10.**21**.\ *XYZ*\ .37

If provisioned from the marketing pool:

- **Cluster Name** - MKT\ *XYZ*
- **Subnet** - 10.**20**.\ *XYZ*\ .0
- **Cluster IP** - 10.**20**.\ *XYZ*\ .37

For example:

- **Cluster Name** - POC055
- **Subnet** - 10.21.55.0
- **Cluster IP** - 10.21.55.37

Throughout the Workshop there are multiple instances where you will need to substitute *XYZ* with the correct octet for your subnet, for example:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1
   * - IP Address
     - Description
   * - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .37
     - Nutanix Cluster Virtual IP
   * - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .39
     - **PC** VM IP, Prism Central
   * - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .40
     - **DC** VM IP, NTNXLAB.local Domain Controller

Each cluster is configured with 2 VLANs which can be used for VMs:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 25 25 10 40
  :header-rows: 1
  * - Network Name
    - Address
    - VLAN
    - DHCP Scope
  * - Primary
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .1/25
    - 0
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .50-10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .124
  * - Secondary
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .129/25
    - *XYZ1*
    - 10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .132-10.21.\ *XYZ*\ .253

Credentials
...........

.. note::

  The *<Cluster Password>* is unique to each cluster and will be provided by the leader of the Workshop.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 35 40
   :header-rows: 1
   * - Credential
     - Username
